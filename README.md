## INSPIRATION   <img width="150" height="100" src="assets/imgs/motivation.png"><br>
The aging population is confronted with an increasingly pressing challenge concerning their mental health and well-being. As individuals advance in age, they become more susceptible to various mental disorders, which, if left undiagnosed and untreated, can significantly impact their quality of life and strain healthcare systems. 

Schizophrenia is not just a diagnosis; it's a journey that demands understanding and compassion. One can see various symptoms like : hallucinations, delusions, impaired attention, change in behaviour and more , along with diagnosis using psychiatric evaluation and clinical interviews .Here we strive to arm individuals with knowledge about schizophrenia. By doing so, we aspire to minimize the social stigma surrounding mental health, encouraging open dialogue and nurturing acceptance.

Our mission is clear: to create awareness, foster empathy, and extend a helping hand to those impacted by this complex mental health issue.

Our goal in this endeavor is to enlighten minds and spark conversations. Just as a single spark can light up a dark room, a single piece of knowledge can dispel ignorance. Through this project, we aim to raise public consciousness about the realities of schizophrenia, its risk factors, and its symptoms. Despite its prevalence, many are unaware of the signs that can signal the onset of this condition. By sharing insights and information, we hope to empower individuals to recognize the signs, seek help, and foster supportive environments.

## How is it working? üóíÔ∏è

Lung cancer prediction using 9 machine learning classification models using Scikit-learn library in Python is a code implementation that aims to develop a predictive model for detecting lung cancer in patients. The code uses 9 different machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision tree, k-nearest neighbor, Gaussian naive Bayes, multinomial naive Bayes, support vector classifier, random forest, multi-layer perceptron, and gradient boosting classifier, to predict the likelihood of lung cancer based on a range of variables. The dataset used in the code includes various columns such as gender, age, smoking, yellow fingers, anxiety, peer pressure, chronic disease, fatigue, allergy, wheezing, alcohol consuming, coughing, shortness of breath, swallowing difficulty, chest pain, and lung cancer. By analyzing these variables and using machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and correlations, the predictive models can provide accurate assessments of a patient's risk of developing lung cancer.
